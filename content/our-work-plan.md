There are three phases for our work plan for the next eight months. This period coincides with our participation in the [NGI ESSIF-Lab Second Business-oriented Open Call](https://essif-lab.eu/open-calls/) (BOC2). Our focus is on proving the concept of Co-operative Credentials via our BOC2 project "Stay Fair Play Fair". At the end of this work plan we're aiming to have the first working implementation of Co-operative Credentials.

## Consultation - October 2021 to December 2021
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| From October to December we'll be focusing on consulting with other co-operatives, industry bodies, infrastructure providers and other stakeholders via our [online community](https://community.coopcreds.com). We'll also be engaging with existing consultation structures, in particular the [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/), and our strongly-supported proposal to form a [Co-op credentials sub-group](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/215).

## Definition - December 2021 to January 2021

|--|:--:|
| We're aiming to release the first draft definition of a co-operative credential by January 2021. We'll be looking to use this credential in our "Stay Fair Play Fair" proof of concept. The goal is to have sufficient input from the relevant stakeholders in the consultation phase to be able to release v0.1 of the credential for trial use. The definition phase will also involve a determination of the initial issuer and verifier of the co-operative credential, aka the ["Ecosystem Model"](/ecosystem-models) [{{<figure src="/images/icons/purple-square.png" title="Register your interest in participating" class="cta" target="_blank">}}](/contact) | {{<figure src="/images/illustrations/definition.svg">}} |

## Implementation - January 2021 to May 2021
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| The last phase of our project will be focused on implementing the co-operative credential amongst the co-operatives supporting this project. Each co-operative will add support to recognise the presentation of a verifiable co-operative credential, and provide membership and associated benefits to the holder. We're providing an [open source Verifiable Credentials plugin for Discourse](https://github.com/coopcreds/discourse-verifiable-credentials) to make it easier for co-operatives to implement this support. We'll also be implementing the issuance and verification of the credential via the designated issuer and verifier.
