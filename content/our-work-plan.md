Our work plan for the next year is focused on implementation of a working live service in multiple co-operative use-cases.  We're also aiming to demonstrate some innovative 'co-operation between co-operatives' across these use cases.  We will refine our strategy and tools for growing the ecosystem.

## Consultation - September 2022 to March 2023
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| We will continue refining the concept and our approach through consultations with co-operatives, industry bodies, infrastructure providers and other stakeholders via our [online community](https://community.coopcreds.com). We'll also be engaging with existing consultation structures, in particular the [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/). In September we will be at [Rebooting the Web of Trust](https://rebootthehague.com/) for face to face discussions on the technologies and our approach to building an SSI ecosystem. Learn more in our [paper - "Identity and Trust in a Co-operative Ecosystem"](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/Identity%20and%20Trust%20in%20a%20Co-operative%20Ecosystem.md)and in our [storyboard](/our-storyboard) prepared for the event. In October we will be at [Relating Systems Thinking and Design - RSD11](https://rsdsymposium.org/university-of-brighton-hosts-rsd11-in-2022/#): We value a multi-disciplinary approach, so we are reaching out to experts in the field of systemic design for service systems, social systems, policy development in complex, human systems. In parallel, we are in discussion with early potential 'enterprise-scale' adopters of Co-op Credentials.  In these discussions we will refine our service offerings, implementation guides and commercial models with help from the Pavilion team.

## Product Refinement - January 2022 to March 2023
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| We aim to release the first draft definition of a co-operative credential in Q1 2023. The goal is to have sufficient input from stakeholders in the consultation phase to be issuing useful credentials to co-operative members. Each co-operative will add support to recognise the presentation of a verifiable co-operative credential, and provide membership and associated benefits to the holder. We'll also be implementing the issuance and verification of the credential via the designated issuer and verifier. Early adopters will influence the options for the issuing and and verifying credentials. We're standards-based, but we remain flexible and pragmatic in integration choices to encourage easy adoption and growth.

## Growth and Governance - June 2023 Onwards
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| Once a viable community of issue, use and verification is established we will work together with stakeholders in our community to grow the common feature set of our product and service: a common, community ID â€“ for members /holders across multiple coops, with exchange and verification of credentials, including streamlined new member onboarding, re-usable KYC and strong, passwordless authentication. As the breadth and scale of our service grows, we will revisit [our ecosystem models](/ecosystem-models) and the key principles and criteria for governance of community direction and service provision.  In this way we aim to create an architecture of trust through transparency and accountability in our co-operative ecosystem.
