Giant corporations have hoovered up our identity information and supposedly ‘safeguarded’ it for us in corporate castles: Facebook, Google, Apple and Spotify, for listeners. They made it all too easy. But hacks and breaches have exposed more and more of these consumer data hoards and we’re all exposed to sneaky surveillance and platform capitalism.

Resonate, Pavilion and FairBnB.coop have been committed to an open, standards-based approach to identity management and privacy - aka ‘digital dignity’. We think co-operatives, co-operating, could make a stand against the big corporates.

The folks at W3C form the open institution that governs the web for openness, interoperability, and vendor neutrality. They care about the erosion of privacy, greedy monetization of technologies and corporate dominance. They are on our side. There is a new wave of identity and privacy standards that can help citizens to fight back, but we need to prove these to be useable and useful at scale, with collaboration and inter-operability.

Resonate has been early to adopt a thing called ‘self sovereign identity’: it puts YOU back in control of the information about YOU. ‘Verifiable Credentials’ is the web standard that helps.

Resonate has been working with Pavilion and Fairbnb.coop to make this standard a reality for co-operatives. We went to w3c and asked them if we could work with them to ensure that co-operatives everywhere, not just our consortium, can access and shape the best technical guidance and thinking on this key technology and how to get the best of it.

The W3C Credentials Community Group loved [our proposals](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/215) and we are now on the way to making a Common Co-operative Membership a reality.
