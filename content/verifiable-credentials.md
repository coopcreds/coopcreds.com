## A Digital Credential
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| A verifiable credential is a digital credential stored in a digital wallet. Like a physical credential, such as a drivers licence, or a university degree, you can use it to prove something. You could use a verifiable credential to prove you're allowed to drive a car, or that you're a qualified accountant.

## Verified as Authentic
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| A verifiable credential is obtained, stored and validated using a computer or smartphone. It's "verifiable" because it can be digitally verified as authentic. Verification essentially works the same way as it does for a physical credential. It involves the organisation which issues the credential, the credential itself, and typically an organisation needing to verify the credential, without having to go back and check with the issuer every time.

## An Industry Standard

| The best part about verifiable credentials are that they're lightweight, easy to use and an industry standard. They're not tied to any company or technology platform. Because they're an [industry standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/), it's easy for organisations and service providers to recognise them.
