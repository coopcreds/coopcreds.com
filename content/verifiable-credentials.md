## A Digital Credential
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| A verifiable credential is a digital credential stored in a digital wallet. Like a physical credential, such as a drivers licence, or a university degree, you can use it to prove something. You could use a verifiable credential to prove you're allowed to drive a car, or that you're a qualified accountant. | {{<figure src="/images/illustrations/credential.svg">}} |

## Verified as Authentic
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| A verifiable credential is obtained, stored and validated using a computer or smartphone. It's "verifiable" because it can be digitally verified as authentic. Verification essentially works the same way as it does for a physical credential. It involves the organisation who issues the credential, the credential itself, and organisation verifying the credential. | {{<figure src="/images/illustrations/process.svg">}} |

## An Industry Standard
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| The best part about verifiable credentials are that they're lightweight, easy to use and an industry standard. They're not tied to any company or technology platform. Because they're an [industry standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/), it's easy for organisations and service providers to recognise them. | {{<figure src="/images/illustrations/industry.svg">}} |
