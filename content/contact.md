We're looking to talk with anyone who's interested in [Co-op Credentials](/coop-credentials), particularly other co-operatives and co-operative industry bodies, as elaborated below. To get the conversation off on the right foot, please review the pages on this site, in particular [What We're Doing](/what-we-are-doing). Correspondence is shared between representatives from FairBnB.coop, Pavilion and Resonate and is kept private.

## Co-operatives

We're looking for other co-operatives to participate in the Co-op Credentials project. Participation means you'll be added alongside FairBnB.coop, Pavilion and Resonate as backers of the project, you'll get a greater involvement in our work on [our community](https://community.coopcreds.com) and community calls, and you'll be invited to participate in a trial of the co-op credentials technology.

## Industry Bodies

We're looking for at least one co-operative industry body to participate as the primary industry partner in the Co-op Credentials project. Participation by an industry body means engagement with our work on [our community](https://community.coopcreds.com), involvement in operational calls and participation in the trial of the co-op credentials technology. We have a small amount of funding to help support the involvement of the appropriate industry body.
