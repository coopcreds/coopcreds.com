## A Partnership of Co-operatives
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| Co-op Credentials is a common co-operative membership implemented through [Verifiable Credentials](/verifiable-credentials) and co-founded by three platform co-operatives: [FairBnB.coop](https://fairbnb.coop), a sustainable vacation rental platform, [Pavilion](https://thepavilion.io), a software provider for online communities and [Resonate](https://resonate.coop), a community-owned music network.

## Proving a Use Case
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| Our partnership supported by [NGI ESSIF-Lab](https://essif-lab.eu/) to test a use case for [Verifiable Credentials](/verifiable-credentials) focused on community-powered independent music micro-touring and tourism. We call our use case “Stay Fair, Play Fair”, and our credential the "Co-op Credential".

## Establishing a Standard
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| While Stay Fair Play Fair is being tested, we're also talking and collaborating with other co-operatives and relevant stakeholders to expand Co-op Credentials to the wider co-operative ecosystem. We're looking to make it standard within the co-operative sector.
