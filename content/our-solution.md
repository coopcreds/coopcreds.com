In response to the three interconnected problems described in [Problems We're Tackling](/problems-were-tackling), FairBnB.coop, Resonate and Pavilion are working on Co-operative Credentials, a [Verifiable Credentials](/verifiable-credentials) backed common co-operative membership. We think that the verifiable credentials standard holds to the key to realising Co-operative Principle 6, specifically: reducing KYC costs within and between co-operatives, increasing cross-selling between co-operatives and supporting de-centralised identity management.

## A Partnership of Co-operatives
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| Co-op Credentials is a common co-operative membership implemented through [Verifiable Credentials](/verifiable-credentials) and co-founded by three platform co-operatives: [FairBnB.coop](https://fairbnb.coop), a sustainable vacation rental platform, [Pavilion](https://thepavilion.io), a software provider for online communities and [Resonate](https://resonate.coop), a community-owned music network. We have real-world experience of the problems laid out in [Problems We're Tackling](/problems-were-tackling), know they are common across the co-operative sector.

## Proving a Use Case
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| The first eight months of our partnership is being supported by [NGI ESSIF-Lab](https://essif-lab.eu/) to test a use case for [Verifiable Credentials](/verifiable-credentials) focused on community-powered independent music micro-touring and tourism. We call this test case “Stay Fair, Play Fair”, and our credential the "Co-op Credential". At the end of our current work plan we aim to have a working prototype of co-op credentials demonstrating a use case. We will use existing verifiable credentials solutions, including our [Discourse Verifiable Credentials plugin](https://github.com/coopcreds/discourse-verifiable-credentials).

## Establishing a Standard
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| While Stay Fair Play Fair is being built and tested, we're also collaborating with other co-operatives and relevant stakeholders to expand Co-op Credentials to the wider co-operative ecosystem. We're aiming to make Co-operative Credentials a standard within the co-operative sector. To that end we've set-up a community to discuss the standard and the [ecosystem models that may be used to implement it](/ecosystem-models). We have also established a sub-committee of the W3C Credentials Community Group for the same purpose, and plan to facilitate that committee via our online community.
