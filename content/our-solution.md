In response to the three interconnected problems described in [Problems We're Tackling](/the-problems), FairBnB.coop, Resonate and Pavilion are working on Co-operative Credentials, a [Verifiable Credentials](/verifiable-credentials) backed common co-operative membership. We think that the verifiable credentials standard holds to the key to realising Co-operative Principle 6, specifically: reducing KYC costs within and between co-operatives, increasing cross-selling between co-operatives and supporting de-centralised identity management.

## A Partnership of Co-operatives
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| Co-op Credentials is a common co-operative membership implemented through [Verifiable Credentials](/verifiable-credentials) and co-founded by three platform co-operatives: [FairBnB.coop](https://fairbnb.coop), a sustainable vacation rental platform, [Pavilion](https://thepavilion.io), a software provider for online communities and [Resonate](https://resonate.coop), a community-owned music network. We have real-world experience of the problems laid out in [Problems We're Tackling](/the-problems), know they are common across the co-operative sector.

## Testing Use Cases
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| The first eight months of our partnership was supported by [NGI ESSIF-Lab](https://essif-lab.eu/) to test use cases for [Verifiable Credentials](/verifiable-credentials) in the co-operative sector. We built a working prototype of co-op credentials implemented live within our own Discourse community - see our [Discourse Verifiable Credentials plugin](https://github.com/coopcreds/discourse-verifiable-credentials). Our next steps are to implement a working live service in multiple co-operative use-cases.  We're also aiming to demonstrate some innovative 'co-operation between co-operatives'. Our [current work plan](/our-work-plan) explains our approach.

## Establishing a Standard
|  |  |
|--|:--:|
| While Co-operative Credentials is being built and tested, we're also collaborating with other co-operatives and relevant stakeholders to expand Co-op Credentials to the wider co-operative ecosystem. We're aiming to make Co-operative Credentials a standard within the co-operative sector. To that end we've set-up a community to discuss the standard and the [ecosystem models that may be used to implement it](/ecosystem-models). We have established a sub-committee of the W3C Credentials Community Group for the same purpose, and plan to facilitate that committee via our online community.  We're also active at conferences and engaged with experts in the field of identity and systemic design.
