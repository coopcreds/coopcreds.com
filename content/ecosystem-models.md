|--|:--:|
| The industry body convenor model involves the establishment of a co-operative industry body as issuer and verifier of the Co-operative Credential, supported by a technology provider such as coopcreds.com. The maintenance costs of the co-operative credential would be distributed between the co-operatives participating in the system, contributed in the form of money and labour via the technology provider.| {{<figure src="/images/illustrations/industry-body.svg">}} |
